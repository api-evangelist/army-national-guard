  The Army National Guard is a reserve component of the United States Army that
  serves both the nation and state in times of need. Its primary mission is to
  provide trained and ready soldiers to support military operations abroad, as
  well as assist with disaster relief and homeland security efforts at home.
  Members of the Army National Guard undergo training and drills on a regular
  basis to ensure they are prepared to deploy at a moment's notice. They play a
  crucial role in defending the country and its citizens, whether it be
  responding to natural disasters, providing security during civil unrest, or
  supporting combat operations overseas. The Army National Guard serves as a
  vital resource for the nation, ready to answer the call to duty whenever and
  wherever they are needed.
